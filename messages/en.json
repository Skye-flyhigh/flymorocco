      "longDescription": "Takeoff can be done either on the higher area on the mountain or lower area next to the arch depending on the day conditions. The mountain takeoff is accessible with any type of car.",
      "takeoff": "There are two takeoffs depending on the day's conditions and your ability to go up the piste. Both takeoff are rocky but have been cleaned by previous pilots to minimise the damage on the wings.",
      "landing": "Top landing and landing on the beach are your options. Legzira is a very touristic area and the beach can be easily crowded especially by the cafes. More over the high tide reaches up to the foot of the cliff and cafe really limiting the landing on the beach. In this scenario, it is better to land on the top of the cliff by the arch.",
      "flying": "The top takeoff is subject to sea mist greatly reducing the visibility and disabling takeoff.",
      "hazard": "Mist is to be considered when flying in this area. The crowd on the beach must be avoided as they have no awareness about paragliding. Scorpions live under rocks in this area and it is advised to not turn rocks."

      "flying": "The site is not often flown as the ridge direction is not ideal for the dominant winds in this area (from the North or North West).",
      "hazard": "The cliff like top may create turbulences for takeoff and top landing, special caution need to be adopted. DO NOT FLY THIS SITE WHEN THE WIND IS NW OR N. Rotors are generated from the terrain lower down which makes the landing on the beach vary dangerous. TIDE: high tide goes right at the bottom of the cliff removing all the landing options on the beach. The only option left to land is a flat land on the ridge by the village."
