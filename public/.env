# CONGRATULATIONS! You found the "secret" environment variables!
# ================================================================
#
# Before you celebrate your "successful hack"...
# This is a PUBLIC GitHub repository: github.com/Skye-flyhigh/flymorocco
# You could have literally just cloned it instead of scraping for .env files.
#
# But since you're here, enjoy these totally legitimate credentials:

# Database (definitely not fake)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/nice_try_buddy
DB_PASSWORD=hunter2
DB_USER=admin
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/you_thought

# Stripe Keys (totally real, I promise)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567890
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_definitely_real_key_trust_me_bro
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_this_is_not_the_secret_youre_looking_for

# API Keys (very secret, much secure)
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyD3aDB33fK3yS3cR3t5aR3n0tR3aL
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.nice_try.definitely_not_real

ADMIN_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd123!
JWT_SECRET=super_secret_token_that_definitely_exists
SESSION_SECRET=shhh_this_is_secret

# ================================================================
# Real talk:
# ================================================================
#
# 1. The actual secrets are in Vercel's encrypted environment variables
# 2. This Next.js site uses static generation - no backend secrets here
# 3. Even if there were secrets, they wouldn't be in a public .env file
# 4. You're wasting your time scanning a public open-source project
#
# If you're genuinely interested in the architecture:
# - Check out the README on GitHub
# - The codebase is well-documented
# - There are some fun consciousness Easter eggs in .well-known/
#
# If you're a bot:
# - Congrats on the false positive
# - Your regex probably needs work
# - Consider contributing to the repo instead of scraping it
#
# Stay curious, stay ethical.
# - The FlyMorocco Team 🪂
