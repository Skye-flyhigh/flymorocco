## 🔥 Developer Lore

> **“The Case of the Missing E”**

During the i18n setup, a rogue param named `local` (missing the "e") hijacked the entire layout and crashed the app via a top-level `await`.  
After hours of meticulous logs, terminal therapy, and a *French-accented scream*, the bug was identified.

🧪 Resolved by explicitly setting:

   
    const { local: locale } = resolvedParams;
    // Official docs said it returns { locale }... THEY LIED. IT'S 'local'.
    // Yes, I logged it. Yes, I screamed.
   

Also the correct solution is in `middleware.ts`, to force the correct `param` key

    createMiddleware({
        ...routing,
        localeParam: 'locale' // << WITH a 'e'
    })

This project will proudly wear the battle scars of this journey.
